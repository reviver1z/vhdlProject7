**Topic 1**
Design the following function with a behavioral description as well as a testbench that checks its operation. F = (A' + B) * (B + A') * (C + C')

**Topic 2**
Design the following function with a structural description as well as a testbench that checks its operation. F = (A' + B) * (B + A') * (C + C')

**Topic 3**
Design a 4-bit adder (with carry out) with a behavioral description as well as a testbench that checks its operation.
Design a 4-bit ripple carry adder with a structural description as well as a testbench that checks its operation.

**Topic 4**
Design a 4-bit subtractor as well as a testbench that checks its operation.

**Topic 5**
DESIGN 4 points: Using the above circuits, design an 8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) with asynchronous reset and enable that implements the operations: addition, subtraction, AND, OR, NOT, as well as a testbench that checks its operation.
OPTIMIZATION 2 points: Optimize the circuits either with the KARNAUGH map method or using VIVADO (use of different Synthesis and Implementation settings) to minimize the AREA.

**Topic 6**
Design:
A. Negative edge-triggered flip-flop with synchronous reset.
B. Positive edge-triggered flip-flop with asynchronous reset and enable.
C. Synchronous 4-bit binary counter with asynchronous reset.
D. 8-bit shift register with asynchronous reset input
as well as a testbench that checks the operation of each.

**Topic 7**
Implement the circuits of topics 5 and 6 as well as a testbench that checks the operation of each in VIVADO and submit the VIVADO projects along with the simulation results. Use different Synthesis and Implementation settings to minimize the AREA (number of LUT/Flip flops).
